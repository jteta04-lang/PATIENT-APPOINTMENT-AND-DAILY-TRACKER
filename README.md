# SCOPE DEFINITION
PROJECT OVERVIEW

The Patient Appointment and Daily Tracker is an integrated healthcare management system designed to streamline patient scheduling, visit tracking, and daily clinical operations. The system centralizes appointment management, patient activity monitoring, and visit outcomes to support efficient service delivery and improved patient care.

By providing real-time visibility into appointments, completed and missed visits, and active patient records, the system enables healthcare providers and administrators to make informed operational and clinical decisions.
It functions as a healthcare Management Information System (MIS), improving workflow efficiency, resource utilization, and overall patient engagement through accurate, data-driven insights.

# Problem Statement

Healthcare facilities often face challenges in managing patient appointments and tracking daily visits due to fragmented or manual systems. 
This leads to missed appointments, inefficient use of clinical resources, limited visibility into patient activity, and difficulties in monitoring performance. 
The lack of centralized data and analytics hinders timely decision-making and reduces the quality and continuity of patient care.
